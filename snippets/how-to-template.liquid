    "name": "In recent years, the value of baseball cards has spiked. In part, this phenomenon is occurring because sneaker collectors have switched to baseball cards. They’re finding that they can turn over much more volume in baseball cards compared to sneakers.  For instance, sneaker collectors will often find that they can only get their hands on one pair of coveted kicks. However, the baseball card market is different. In fact, you can learn how to collect baseball cards and buy as many as you can afford.  In addition, not only do baseball card collectors have the opportunity to purchase more cards. They can diversify their collections in ways that sneakerheads can’t.  In baseball card collecting, nostalgia is driving a surge in the industry. Sports fans from the 80s are causing a shift in the market.  Now, these fans have young children, they love to see their kids take part in the same fun activities that they used to enjoy as children. Every 30 years, you’ll see a reboot of G.I. Joe toys for the same reason.",

Alternatively, you may want to buy football cards. You can even invest in wholesale football cards. Ultimately, the choice is yours, even if you get started by figuring out how to start collecting baseball cards.  In fact, there’s a market for all your favorite sports, even soccer cards. You might even consider investing in soccer card boxes or soccer card cases.  Sports betting is also contributing to increased activity in the baseball card industry.

    "name": "Yes, it’s true. Some gamblers use collectible sports cards as a way to get skin into the game. Flipping cards is a low-risk way of betting on the sport.  For instance, you might bet on your favorite team to win again. Alternatively, you might bet on your favorite player to make a certain amount of points in the game.  In either case, buying and selling sports cards is a safer way to get your thrills. If things don’t go your way, you won’t necessarily lose all your money. With this in mind, there are two high-level categories of sports cards—graded and raw. This is important to know when you’re figuring out how to start collecting sports cards.  GRADED OR RAW? Here, you have two options. You can purchase cards that have already been graded.  Alternatively, you can purchase raw sports cards. These items are cards that collectors haven’t submitted to a grading company.  There’s a lower barrier to entry for raw cards. They cost less compared to graded cards. They haven’t been officially graded for value—yet. As a result, they cost less to buy.",

    "name": "You’ll want to set a budget right from the start when you’re learning how to start collecting sports cards. Without a budget, it’s easy to spend much more than you can afford.  Here, you want to think about what you want to accomplish financially. For instance, you may want to build a collection. Alternatively, you may want to earn a fast return on your baseball cards.  In fact, there are a few different ways that you can plan your baseball card investment strategy if you have a specific goal like how to start collecting baseball cards. The following are just a few.  INVESTING FOR THE LONG HAUL Long-term baseball card investing requires a specific strategy. It’s different from buying cards for short-term investment.  Here, you’re looking for long-term growth and minimal risk. With this in mind, think of generational notoriety when you purchase cards.  For instance, you’re not looking for cards of players who recently had a great game. Instead, you’re on the hunt for generational icons. These are the cards that you use to build your long-term collection when you first learn how to start collecting sports cards.  FLIPPING CARDS Conversely, flipping baseball cards is a form of short-term investment. With this method, you want to buy baseball cards for as low as possible. When flipping cards, you’ll also want to look for new sports card releases.  Next, you’ll flip it in a few days, weeks, or months. Some collectors consider any sale less than a year after purchase a short-term sale. Here, however, you’ll earn your profits based on a player’s future performance or overall value.  Again, flipping it’s all about short-term money. To win in the flipping game, you need a deep understanding of the sport. It’s also highly beneficial to understand the inherent risk of flipping.  HOW TO START COLLECTING SPORTS CARDS: KEEPING COLLECTIBLES Alternatively, some baseball fans want cards as collectibles. There are many baseball card collectors whose sole goal is to build a valuable collection. These individuals are true fans of the game.  For instance, you might want to collect cards for memorializing your favorite player. This practice is an amazing hobby that offers loads of enjoyment.  This kind of baseball card investor is simply happy with collecting their favorite cards. However, if you really enjoy the sport, flipping cards is fun too.  CHOOSING A MANUFACTURER Some collectors prefer to invest in cards from specific manufacturers. Two of the leading manufacturers in the field are Panini and Topps, and these will stand out, whether you want to know how to start collecting sports cards or how to start collecting baseball cards, rather than multiple cards from all different kinds of sports. The following is a closer look at what the companies have to offer.  PANINI Panini is an Italian collectibles manufacturer. The company offers several products, including the:  Panini baseball box Panini baseball case Panini basketball box Panini basketball case Panini football box Panini football case Panini soccer box Panini soccer case Panini is a well-known company that’s been around since 1961.  PANINI PRIZM For beginners, Panini offers an affordable line called Prizm. The Prizm line might include the:  Prizm basketball box Prizm football box Prizm hobby box Prizm hobby case If you’re just starting out, Prizm collectibles are a great way to test the waters.  PANINI SELECT Alternatively, Select is Panini’s assortment of high-end collectibles for those looking to discover how to start collecting sports cards. If you want to assume greater risk, Panini Select is a great place to start. Here, you might try your luck with a Select hobby box or the Select hobby case.  TOPPS Of course, Topps is one of the greatest collectibles companies in the United States. Topps offers a range of collectibles, including the:  Topps baseball box Topps baseball cards Topps baseball case They’ve been around since 1951.",

    "name": "There are a lot of people getting back into collecting baseball cards. Before you start with this exciting hobby, however, you want to learn how to figure out the value of your cards.  Many people get back into baseball card collecting by figuring out the value of their existing collection. These individuals have held onto cards from their youth, even if they may be just getting back into it and learning how to start collecting sports cards once again.  It may surprise you to learn what value you have tucked away in the back of your closet. There are a few things that you’ll want to check to find out the value of your good old card election.  Firstly, you’ll want to figure out the year of your cards. Here, you can check the copyright date of the card. Alternatively, you can look at the final year of the stats included on the card.  You also want to find out the name of the card company. Also, pinpoint the name of the player.  Finally, you’ll want to find the card number. Once you have this information, there are a few things that will affect the value of your cards.  VINTAGE OR MODERN? Some collectors believe vintage cards are a better investment, and this is something you will want to consider if you’re planning on figuring out how to start collecting sports cards. There are fewer variables to consider.  For instance, sports card favorites, such as Willie Mays and Babe Ruth, are forever baseball icons. Accordingly, the value of their cards will not fluctuate as much compared to modern baseball cards.  In addition, the supply of cards won’t increase along with demand. As a result, many collectors view vintage cards as a safer investment. Alternatively, supporters of modern cards believe that there’s more opportunity for short-term gains.  SUPPLY AND DEMAND Like many other fields, supply and demand are the cornerstones of baseball card collecting. Supply is the number of sports cards in circulation. It can have a huge effect on the value of your card.  You can check a site such as PSA for a report on graded cards in circulation—more on grading companies in a moment. You’ll need the set information for your card to look up the report. With this information, you can find a population of all cards in that set.  CHOOSING A GRADING COMPANY After you’ve figured out how to start collecting sports cards or specific options like how to start collecting baseball cards, you need to know what shape your cards are in. A grading company evaluates the condition of your cards. The biggest grading company in the game is PSA.  The second-largest grading company is BGS. Meanwhile, SGC is the third-largest sports card grading company.  You can submit raw, ungraded cards to these companies for evaluation. They’ll assess it with a grade of 1 to 10. After grading, the company will enclose your card in a case.  CARD CONDITION In addition to a player’s performance, there are a few things that a grading company will look at when they evaluate your baseball cards. For instance, they’ll examine the surface of the cards. The grading company will check to see if the card has any scratches.  They’ll also look at the corners and edges. The grading company will check whether the corners are frayed. They’ll also inspect the card for creases.  Finally, the grading company will look at the centering of the card. They’ll look to see how well the player is centered on the card.",

It’s always important to collect because of your passion for collecting. If you happen to get some great cards along the way, that’s a bonus!   With that disclaimer in mind, the first step is to do your research about the cards in your collection when you find yourself asking, “How do I sell my baseball cards?” This means:  Figuring out what year your card is from. This can be determined by the manufacturer, stats, and copyright date. If you have a vintage card that might be lacking these characteristics, you can enlist Google’s help to search for specific images or phrases on the card.  Understanding what makes cards worth something. Does your card have a superstar that people want in their collection that is a short print or a rookie card? Is it exceedingly rare or difficult to get your hands on? Is it in stellar condition because you take care of your card collection?  Look for how much your card has sold elsewhere or what other sellers are currently asking for. 130 Point is a great site to research recent sale prices. A card is not worth what Beckett has the list price at, it is only worth what someone is willing to pay. The best way to sell sports cards is to make sure that you have a reasonable ask that’s proportionate to the actual value of your cards.  The research phase is arguably the most important. Make sure that you do your research to fully understand what you have in your collection that might be worth selling or consult a professional that can help you with the process.",

Why Should I Collect Wholesale Football Cards?

    "name": "You can buy football cards in wholesale lots, but there are a few things to consider before you do if you’re itching to learn how to buy football cards this way.  First of all, you need to make sure that the cost per card is lower when buying wholesale than if you were just purchasing one or two packs at a time from your local hobby shop. It's usually not worth it unless you're planning on opening more than 50 boxes of football cards, because then the price drops significantly and makes them much cheaper for each individual pack.  Another thing to think about is ensuring that these wholesale deals aren't scams, so be careful! Remember: if something looks too good to be true...it probably is. On top of this, while most people have heard horror stories about splitting open cases only to find garbage-filled boxes, this is not always the case.  If you do your research and buy from a reliable wholesale football cards supplier or broker, then there's no reason why you can't find some really great deals on high-value listings as well!  Football cards are cheaper per pack if purchased in large quantities. You will also have more room to store extra cards that may be duplicated. This means you can start specific collections for those who collect by team, player name/number, etc.",

    "name": "In order to buy wholesale football cards from a registered sports card distributor, you will need to apply for wholesale dealer status with an online distributor's website.  In this situation, your application is going to be passed on and reviewed by the wholesale company's customer service team who work behind the scenes to process applications.  This process is actually straightforward as long as you keep a few things in mind.  First of all, make sure that the distributor's website has an option for dealers to apply for wholesale dealer registration.  Second, ensure that there's no fee involved at any stage. This might sound obvious, but it does sometimes happen! You should not pay for registration, and this is something to keep in mind as you learn how to buy football cards the right way.  When submitting your application via email or online form, provide as much information as possible about yourself and how many wholesale football cards sets you're planning on buying per year.  Finally, don't forget to read through any terms and conditions before signing up. You don't want to be taken by surprise when it comes to the fine print.  Once you've been approved, wholesale football card boxes will be sent to your home once a month. This is where it gets fun because wholesale dealers can buy wholesale cards in bulk from their supplier for reduced prices!  There are plenty of places that sell wholesale football cards online, such as eBay, Amazon, and other e-commerce websites. However, buying wholesale sports cards from an officially registered distributor gives you the best selection and options to choose from when looking to buy wholesale cards or any other type of sports trading cards at great prices.",

This will give customers more confidence to buy your stock amidst stiff competition from other online sellers as well as brick-and-mortar wholesale suppliers.
